          Hands2Heart is a platform that gives visibility to beautiful handicrafts made by children with special needs.
          These talented learners often lack access to markets due to limited exposure â€” we help bridge that gap.
          By showcasing their work, we connect them with buyers, donors, and supporters who believe in creativity, inclusion, and impact.
