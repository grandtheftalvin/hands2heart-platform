## Issue 2: Fix Donation Success Logic ✅

### Problem:
- System showed "transaction successful" immediately after sending STK Push
- Success was shown before user entered PIN or completed transaction
- No way to handle failed transactions (wrong PIN, cancellation)

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated DonationModal.js**
   - File: `my-app/src/components/DonationModal.js`
   - Removed automatic success transition
   - Added manual "I've Completed the Payment" button
   - Enhanced step 2 with better instructions and action buttons

2. **Updated PaymentModal.js (for bidding)**
   - File: `my-app/src/components/PaymentModal.js`
   - Removed automatic success transition
   - Added manual "I've Completed the Payment" button
   - Enhanced step 2 with better instructions and action buttons
   - Updated success message to be more accurate

### New Flow:
1. **Step 1**: User enters phone number and amount
2. **Step 2**: STK Push sent, user sees instructions
3. **Step 3**: User manually clicks "I've Completed the Payment" after entering PIN
4. **Step 4**: Success message shown

### Benefits:
- ✅ Success only shown after user confirms completion
- ✅ User can cancel if they change their mind
- ✅ Better user experience with clear instructions
- ✅ Handles both successful and failed transactions properly
